History
-------
The first version of the software originated in 2007 out of an extracurricular project by Christoph Hösler,
Thomas Schmidt and Wolfgang Siewert, and was funded by the MFG Baden-Württemberg (centre of excellence for IT,
media and film of the federal state Baden-Württemberg)
[For more information visit their homepage at [asoem.org](http://asoem.org)].
Since 2010, [Christoph Hösler](http://github.com/hoesler) reworked it to implement simulation models
for his PhD project in evolutionary biology at the University of Tübingen (Germany).
